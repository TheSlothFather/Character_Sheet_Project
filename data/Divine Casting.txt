Worship and Divine Intervention


        Worship is the ability to acquire Deity Relationship with one or more deities. This is the currency you accrue through roleplay and various actions to use divine intervention, which is divine magic, and that is related to clergy, shamans, druids, paladins, and others of this ilk. Devotion to a deity(s) allows you to accrue deity relationship per moon face equal to your Spiritual Attribute with a worship check of 50 for up to 20% of your Deity Relationship Cap, 75 for up to 40% of your Deity Relationship Cap, 100 for up to 60% of your Deity Relationship Cap, 125 for up to 80% of your Deity Relationship Cap, and 150 for up to 100% of your Deity Relationship Cap, each of these targets increasing by 15 per character’s Spiritual Attribute. If you wish to worship multiple deities, you must choose which one you are dedicating yourself to on that moon face, bar various features or ancillaries. Every deity also has three categories of worship that allow you to make more worship checks to more quickly gain these points when you perform actions from the deity’s worship list. Some worship is active, and some is passive. Passives generate 3x your Spiritual Attribute instead of the base passive point generation. Barring certain features or ancillaries, you may dedicate yourself to Spiritual Attribute number of deities. You may either worship the aligned (good) or unaligned (evil). If you ignore this requirement and choose to worship a deity belonging to the opposite of what you have been devoting yourself to, you lose all of your deity relationship with all deities of the group you belonged to in a grand declaration of apostasy. Apostasy is a grave decision with dire consequences, but it can unlock certain ancillaries for a player character. Aligned is composed of the Light Sect, Knowledge Sect, Ice Sect, Fire Sect, Nature Sect, and Redeemed Dark Sect. There are numerous pieces of gear, such as religious texts, religious organization signifiers, and vestments or divine weapons and armors, etc, that can be equipped to help with worship and divine intervention. The three worships of a deity earn you the points demarcated in parentheses, multiplied by your Spiritual Attribute.  
        Unlike with Psionic Techniques and Will Dakar, Divine Intervention is neither energy nor action point intensive, costing 1 each regardless of the strength of the spell. The limiting factor is how much worship you can accrue outside of combat and timed events (or in some rare cases, during). Another major difference between this method of casting and the others is that the player has less clear control over the effects of the spell. Instead of casting a spell, the player character beseeches a deity they have deity relationship points with. The GM plays as the deities and has instructions for all deities’ divine intervention lists and every specific divine intervention, categorized into each of the deity’s three spells. Each spell has seven divine interventions, which are essentially seven tiers of the spell, each costing an increasing number of deity relationship points to use. According to the situation, the deity then chooses to react with according severity or aid. The player chooses which of the three spells, and the deity determines how powerful the spell tier is. The more help is needed, the higher the tier, and the more deity relationship points it will cost upon you completing a successful divine intervention check. The GM may best see divine intervention as the employment of help from a very powerful ally NPC. You have to trust your deity’s judgement. Equipping religious texts allows you to be more specific with the tier of divine intervention asked for, dependent upon the tier of said religious text.
