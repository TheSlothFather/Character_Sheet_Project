Attributes and Skills




                                             Character Creation Point Allocation



During character creation, you will be given 3 Attribute Points to spread across your Attributes. You may take up to 1
negative attribute point in a given attribute, but at character creation, you may not have any more than 3 attribute points
in a given attribute. For each attribute point added or subtracted, all associated skills increase or decrease by 10. 4
categories of the skills are associated with 1 attribute, and 6 categories of the skills are associated with 2 attributes,
whereby you add together the positive and negative 10-point bonuses from both attributes. In addition, you have 100 skill
points to allocate, independent of bonuses added to skills by attributes, background, and race. You can apply these to
skills, will dakar, and to martial prowess. You cannot take negative skill points. Martial prowess also has a baseline
determined by race and certain pieces of your background. You cannot have martial prowess above +30 at character creation
once all of your baseline and allocated skill points are added together.  



The Skills




                                             Challenge Rolls and Contested Rolls



While playing the ARPG, all mechanical interactions can be divided into two categories: Challenge Rolls and Contested
Rolls. Challenge Rolls occur when you are performing an action that does not involve another creature or NPC. Contested
Rolls are when you are matching one of your skills against a creature or NPC’s skills. Challenge Rolls will have target
numbers set by the GM. Generally speaking, the target difficulty is based on a mundane individual’s ability to accomplish a
task, where 0 is a task the player character cannot fail (eg, opening an unlocked door or walking across a hazard-free
surface) and 100 is the peak of what a person could succeed at bar magical or technological aid (eg, world-class feats of
strength or intellect) or the highest levels of expertise. 100+ is supernatural.
|Mundane        |Focused      |Intermediate         |Challenging       |Peak    |
|0              |25           |50                   |75                |100     |
