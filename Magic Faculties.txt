1. THERMOMANCY
Pyromancy (Heat) ↔ Cryomancy (Cold)
Thermomancy manipulates thermal energy: introducing heat (Pyro) or removing it (Cryo).
Effects scale from mild warmth/frost to absolute temperature extremes at Tier 6.

TIER 1
Pyromancy – Primary Effect
Slightly warm small objects, dry damp items, or ignite loose tinder. Flames produced are weak and easily extinguished. Metals are warmed to the touch but not enough to deform.
Environmental Consequence (Cryomancy)
A faint chill radiates around the target area. Surfaces feel cool, condensation forms, and breath becomes faintly visible. Frost lightly dusts exposed materials but does not impede movement.
Statuses:
Primary: None or Burning (1 burn wound) on direct contact
Ring: None

TIER 2
Pyromancy – Primary Effect
Ignite wood, cloth, and leather; boil water; melt soft metals such as tin or lead. Flames spread across flammable surfaces and generate smoke that reduces visibility.
Environmental Consequence (Cryomancy)
The surrounding ring abruptly cools, forming thin ice films on stone and metal. Air becomes brittle and stinging, and wet surfaces freeze slick. Creatures entering the ring risk Freezing (1) or Slowed for a round.
Statuses:
Primary: Burning, Burn wounds
Ring: Freezing, Slowed

Cryomancy – Primary Effect
Freeze water solid, cause frostbite on exposed skin, stiffen ropes and fabrics, and make common metals brittle at points of stress.
Environmental Consequence (Pyromancy)
Warm air bleeds in from the boundary. Ice sublimates, puddles reappear, and exposed skin tingles with sudden warmth. Brief hot pockets can sting for Burn (1) if touched.
Statuses:
Primary: Freezing, Slowed, Prone (ice slip)
Ring: Minor Burning

TIER 3 
Pyromancy – Primary Effect
Melt common metals (iron, bronze), crack masonry, and generate bursts of flame large enough to engulf a room corner. Smoke becomes thick, and radiant heat can scorch creatures at a distance.
Environmental Consequence (Cryomancy)
A ring of intense cold expands outward: frost rapidly spreads along walls, ice crystals form mid-air and fall like glittering dust, and floor tiles gain slick patches. Creatures entering risk Freezing, Slowed, or Prone from footing failure.
Statuses:
Primary: Burning, Burn wounds, Blinded (smoke)
Ring: Freezing, Slowed, Prone

Cryomancy – Primary Effect
Rapidly freeze creatures or objects, creating brittle shatter points. Walls and floors glaze with ice thick enough to lock doors or jam mechanisms. Prolonged exposure drops core temperature sharply.
Environmental Consequence (Pyromancy)
Air around the cold zone warms sharply, causing steam bursts and dripping condensation. Surfaces become wet and hot to the touch, inflicting Burn (1) on bare skin. Temperature contrast may obscure vision briefly.
Statuses:
Primary: Freezing, Slowed, Unconscious (extreme cold)
Ring: Burning (1), Prone (slippery melt)

TIER 4
Pyromancy – Primary Effect
Liquefy stone or brick, vaporize wood, and destabilize load-bearing structures through thermal shock. Floors buckle from uneven expansion, and metal fixtures deform or droop.
Environmental Consequence (Cryomancy)
A thick freezing band forms instantly. Air temperature plummets, breath crystallizes, and surfaces are coated in hazardous layers of ice. Frostbite risk is immediate on exposed skin. Movement becomes dangerous, invoking Freezing, Slowed, or Prone.
Statuses:
Primary: Severe Burning, Burn wounds, Blinded (heat shimmer)
Ring: Freezing (Intensity), Slowed, Prone

Cryomancy – Primary Effect
Encases entire rooms in solid ice, freezes mechanisms until they fracture, and shatters stone or metal plating. Girders and supports may snap, causing partial collapses.
Environmental Consequence (Pyromancy)
Heat radiates outward, causing ice to crack explosively, spraying shards. Bystanders may receive light Burn (1) from contact with superheated steam. Surfaces shift abruptly from ice to slush.
Statuses:
Primary: Freezing, Unconscious, Slowed
Ring: Burning (1), Prone

TIER 5 
Pyromancy – Primary Effect
Firestorms engulf multiple structures; metals soften en masse; liquids boil explosively; vegetation combusts on contact. Buildings may collapse purely from heat distortion.
Environmental Consequence (Cryomancy)
A coldfront forms around the inferno. Snow-like ice crystals swirl violently, obscuring vision. Ground frost spreads rapidly. Creatures entering this band risk Freezing, Slowed, and Prone from frozen terrain.
Statuses:
Primary: Intense Burning, Blinded, Burn wounds
Ring: Freezing, Slowed, Prone

Cryomancy – Primary Effect
Flash-freezes entire streets or caverns, shattering terrain and immobilizing groups of creatures. Frozen structures collapse under their own brittleness.
Environmental Consequence (Pyromancy)
An expanding heat ring rapidly melts the periphery, creating sudden fog, slippery slush, and loud thermal cracks. Creatures entering take Burn (1–2) and must check for Prone.
Statuses:
Primary: Severe Freezing, Unconscious, Slowed
Ring: Burning, Prone

TIER 6
Pyromancy – Primary Effect
Generate plasma columns, vaporize matter, erase terrain features, melt entire sections of landscape, or ignite atmospheric layers. Survivors suffer total sensory distortion.
Environmental Consequence (Cryomancy)
A catastrophic cold rebalance occurs. An encircling wall of sub-zero wind erupts, flash-freezing vegetation and stone. Ice forms faster than gravity can pull water down. Anything entering suffers Freezing (max) or immediate Unconsciousness.
Statuses:
Primary: Fatal Burning, Unconscious
Ring: Severe Freezing

Cryomancy – Primary Effect
Drop temperatures to absolute stillness, freezing matter into crystalline dust or halting motion entirely. Forests, buildings, and rivers lock into immobility.
Environmental Consequence (Pyromancy)
Superheated expansion erupts outward as reality reclaims heat. The ring scorches terrain, melts ice in pulses, and blinds creatures with sudden glare. Burn (2–3) for all exposed creatures.
Statuses:
Primary: Fatal Freezing, Unconscious
Ring: Intense Burning

====================================
2. GRAVITURGY
Hypergravity (Weight/Compression) ↔ Hypogravity (Lightness/Buoyancy)
Graviturgy manipulates local gravitational strength, altering mass, momentum, and vertical stability.

TIER 1
Hypergravity – Primary Effect
Increase the weight of handheld items; make footsteps heavier; cause dust to settle instantly. Sensations include joint stiffness and mild downward tugging.

Ring: None

TIER 2
Hypergravity – Primary Effect
Weigh down tools, weapons, and small creatures. Movements become sluggish; thrown items drop prematurely; weapon swings feel dragged.
Environmental Consequence (Hypogravity)

Statuses:
Primary: Crushing, Slowed
Ring: Prone

Hypogravity – Primary Effect
Lighten objects drastically; reduce traction on floors; allow small debris to float. Movement becomes bouncy and imprecise.

Statuses:
Primary: Prone, Hastened, Slowed
Ring: Prone

TIER 3 
Hypergravity – Primary Effect
Pin weaker creatures to the ground, crack wooden beams, bend metal rods, compress air into visible shimmer distortions.

Adjacent areas become semi-weightless. Furniture floats slightly, liquids form globules, and creatures stepping in may drift sideways involuntarily. Risk of Prone from loss of traction.
Statuses:
Primary: Crushing, Blunt wounds, Dazed, Prone
Ring: Prone

Hypogravity – Primary Effect
Cause temporary hovering; detach unsecured items from surfaces; create slow-motion fall zones. Air thins perceptibly.

Statuses:
Primary: Prone, Hastened, Suffocating (thin air)
Ring: Slowed

TIER 4
Hypergravity – Primary Effect
Crush furnishings into splinters; warp stone archways; collapse ceilings. Metal beams bend inward as if under immense load.

Statuses:
Primary: Severe Crushing, Unconscious
Ring: Prone

Hypogravity – Primary Effect
Remove structural weight; cause entire rooms to float or tilt; dislodge anchored machinery. Liquids form airborne sheets.

Statuses:
Primary: Prone, Dazed, Suffocating
Ring: Blunt wounds (falling debris)

TIER 6
Hypergravity – Primary Effect
Collapse hills, crush forests, buckle earth layers. Gravity wells form, dragging matter inward and pulverizing structures.
Environmental Consequence (Hypogravity)
A surrounding region becomes wildly buoyant: trees suspend roots-first in the air, rivers bead into floating water spheres, and boulders drift.
Statuses:
Primary: Fatal Crushing
Ring: Prone, Dazed

Hypogravity – Primary Effect
Cause landscapes to lift, break apart, or drift skyward. Entire ecosystems float, creating vacuum pockets and unstable drift regions.
Environmental Consequence (Hypergravity)
Reasserted gravity slams objects downward at random intervals, producing quakes and falling terrain.
Statuses:
Primary: Unconscious, Suffocating
Ring: Crushing (minor–moderate)

====================================
3. ELECTROMANCY
Association (Binding/Charge) ↔ Disassociation (Dissolution/Acid)
Electromancy controls cohesion, charge, nervous stimulation, and corrosive breakdown.

TIER 1
Association – Primary Effect
Generate static sparks, cause hair to rise, make metallic items cling together lightly. Nerves tingle when touched.
Environmental Consequence (Disassociation)
Metal tarnishes slightly at the edges of the zone. Fine dust weakly repels itself, giving the air a gritty feel.

====================================
4. PHOTOMANCY
Illumination (Light/Visibility/Illusions) ↔ Attenuation (Dimming/Shadow/Darkness)
Photomancy manipulates light as both energy and perception.
Illumination creates, sharpens, shapes, or bends light into illusions.
Attenuation removes, distorts, or collapses light into shadow or darkness.
Attenuation gains magical darkness at Tier 3 and scales into full sensory suppression.

TIER 1
Illumination – Primary Effect
Brighten dark areas, create simple static illusions (glimmers, small holographic shapes, sparks), enhance reflections, or sharpen visual contrast. Illusions are flat and lack depth but can attract attention.
Environmental Consequence (Attenuation)
Shadows soften slightly and colors appear muted in the ring. Edges lose crispness but remain perceivable.
Statuses:
Primary: None
Ring: None

Attenuation – Primary Effect
Dim lights, slightly blur shapes, soften outlines, or reduce visibility gradients. Limited illusions of vague shadow-movement (non-deceptive) can be created.
Environmental Consequence (Illumination)
Dimness is countered by a faint bright halo around the zone; reflective surfaces twinkle lightly.
Statuses:
Primary: None
Ring: None

TIER 2
Illumination – Primary Effect
Produce focused beams, radiant flares, or visual illusions the size of a small creature or object. These illusions can be colored, textured, and animated, but lack solidity and sound.
Examples: false item appearances, glowing runes, decoy shapes.
Environmental Consequence (Attenuation)
Perimeter shadows deepen noticeably. Visual contrast distorts slightly, causing creatures entering the ring to misread distance briefly.
Statuses:
Primary: Blinded (flash), Revealed
Ring: Stupification (momentary visual confusion)

Attenuation – Primary Effect
Blur object boundaries, obscure identification, and project minor shadow illusions (false silhouettes, shifting outlines). Real objects appear dull and semitransparent.
Environmental Consequence (Illumination)
Peripheral reflections spike. Small light flecks appear around the border, distracting the eye and occasionally imposing Blinded (1).
Statuses:
Primary: Concealed, Slowed (misjudged footing)
Ring: Blinded (minor)

TIER 3 
Illumination gains TRUE ILLUSION at this tier.
Illusions can now appear three-dimensional, animated, and convincing within a room.
Illumination – Primary Effect
Flood a room with clear light or create realistic visual illusions up to creature-scale: phantoms, false doors, misleading terrain, or light-constructed decoys. These illusions can move, react vaguely, and mimic distant sound (visually implied but not auditory).
Can also erase mundane shadows entirely.
Environmental Consequence (Attenuation)
A band of deepening shadow forms. Ambient light behaves erratically—stretching or thickening—creating pockets where creatures can hide or lose track of terrain.
Statuses:
Primary: Blinded, Revealed
Ring: Concealed, Prone (visual misinterpretation)

Attenuation – Primary Effect
Create magical darkness that entirely negates normal light. Illusions formed inside appear only as faint distortions. Creatures may lose depth perception or orientation.
Shadows can form semi-illusory shapes that confuse movement.
Environmental Consequence (Illumination)
A bright ring contracts around the darkness, producing glare and visual overload. Adjusting vision induces Blinded (1–2) or forced perception checks.
Statuses:
Primary: Blinded, Deafened (sensory collapse), Stupification
Ring: Blinded

TIER 4
Illumination – Primary Effect
Illuminate entire structures or create multi-room illusions with coherent movement: armies marching, collapsing walls, phantom fires, visual mazes. Illusions may mimic light-based solidity (e.g., hard-light panels) though they still lack physical force.
Perfect for deception, misdirection, or large-scale hazard illusions.
Environmental Consequence (Attenuation)
Shadows outside the illuminated zone grow unnaturally long. Depth perception distorts: hallways seem stretched; corners appear closer or farther than they are. Creatures may stumble or misread cover.
Statuses:
Primary: Blinded, Revealed
Ring: Stupification, Prone

Attenuation – Primary Effect
Swallow entire structures in advanced magical darkness. Even magical light sources struggle. Illusions formed inside appear as faint silhouettes or are consumed entirely. Sensory input becomes unreliable.
Environmental Consequence (Illumination)
Cracks of bright light rupture along walls or objects around the darkness. Dust glitters, surfaces glow, and sudden flashes can impose Blinded (2) on entry.
Statuses:
Primary: Blinded, Concealed, Deafened, Stupification
Ring: Blinded

TIER 5 
Illumination – Primary Effect
Simulate daylight across a district or cavern system; negate magical darkness; create mass illusions such as armies, monsters, environmental transformations, or entirely false landscapes.
Can expose invisible creatures by harsh silhouette lighting.
Environmental Consequence (Attenuation)
A vast dimming ring forms: mist-like shadow, inconsistent visibility, elongated silhouettes, misleading terrain cues. Creatures may intermittently gain or lose concealment.
Statuses:
Primary: Blinded, Revealed
Ring: Concealed, Stupification

Attenuation – Primary Effect
Engulf whole sectors in expansive magical darkness. Navigation becomes guesswork; illusions become unreliable or warped into horror-like shadow imitations.
Can create shifting void-shapes that mimic creatures or terrain.
Environmental Consequence (Illumination)
The boundary emits pulsating glare. Surfaces reflect wildly, creating sudden light spikes. Intense brightness disorients and blinds.
Statuses:
Primary: Blinded, Unconscious (sensory overload), Stupification
Ring: Blinded (severe)

TIER 6
Illumination – Primary Effect
Create light visible for miles; forge illusory landscapes or cities; reveal hidden cosmic structures; banish all darkness across entire regions.
Illusions at this tier can mimic entire armies, environments, or weather phenomena, though still lacking physical force.
Environmental Consequence (Attenuation)
Shadows at the border grow dense enough to resemble fog. Terrain within the ring becomes illusory or misleading: cliffs appear level, openings seem blocked, silhouettes multiply.
Statuses:
Primary: Blinded (intense), Revealed
Ring: Stupification, Prone

Attenuation – Primary Effect
Erase all natural and magical light in a region. Vision is impossibly black. Living creatures lose spatial awareness entirely. Even illusions dissolve into shapeless void.
Environmental Consequence (Illumination)
A radiant, burning glare erupts around the boundary—so bright that creatures cannot look toward it. Terrain edges glow white-hot visually, though not thermally.
Statuses:
Primary: Total Blinded, Unconscious, Stupification
Ring: Severe Blinded, Prone

====================================
7. TRANSMUTATION 
Synthesis (Binding/Creation/Reinforcement) ↔ Decompose (Unmaking/Separation/Breakdown)

This depletion is visible but not dangerous.
Statuses:
Primary → None
Ring → None

Decompose – Primary Effect
Separate simple mixtures (sand from water, dust from air).

====================================
8. TELECHRONOMANCY
Space (Position/Geometry/Direction) ↔ Time (Acceleration/Delay/Duration)
Telechronomancy manipulates how space is arranged and how time flows locally, never its order or history.
This is the faculty most tightly regulated by metaphysical constraints.

TIER 1
Space – Primary Effect
Shift small objects slightly; bend paths of thrown items by inches; cause corridors to appear marginally longer or shorter; make a cup seem slightly farther than it is.
Environmental Consequence (Time)
A ring of minor temporal wobble forms:
    • motion appears fractionally delayed or ahead
    • sound arrives with tiny offsets
    • visual perception shimmers subtly
It is disorienting but harmless.
Statuses:
Primary → None
Ring → Stupification (fleeting perceptual lag)

Time – Primary Effect
Speed up or slow small processes (dripping water, ember burn rate).
A creature’s blink or head turn may occur slightly faster or slower, but not meaningfully in combat.
Environmental Consequence (Space)
Straight lines appear subtly skewed at the perimeter; floor tiles “don’t quite line up” visually.
Statuses:
Primary → None
Ring → Dazed (brief spatial-perception mismatch)

TIER 2
Space – Primary Effect
Teleport small objects across short distances.
Curve the trajectory of projectiles.
Create shallow spatial distortions—corridors with slight bends where none exist.
Environmental Consequence (Time)
Motion inside the ring develops micro-lag:
    • hands appear to “ghost” behind actions
    • stepping feels fractionally delayed
    • thrown items leave short afterimages
Statuses:
Primary → Prone (misstep risk), Blinded (momentary distortion)
Ring → Stupification

Time – Primary Effect
Speed up a single weapon swing; slow a single thrown object; extend or shorten a spell’s duration within limits.
Creatures may experience brief bursts of fast-or-slow-time.
Environmental Consequence (Space)
Spatial relations jitter slightly:
    • corners appear stretched
    • doorframes wobble
    • objects seem closer/farther than they are
Statuses:
Primary → Slowed, Hastened
Ring → Prone (misjudged distance)

TIER 3 
Space – Primary Effect
Fold space within a room:
    • two corners temporarily connect
    • pathways double back subtly
    • a doorway may exit into the same room at another angle
    • create small teleport anchors
Environmental Consequence (Time)
Temporal drag or slip emerges:
    • actions feel a half-second behind
    • conversations de-sync
    • footsteps echo at unnatural intervals
Statuses:
Primary → Dazed, Prone, Blinded (spatial shearing)
Ring → Stupification, Slowed

Time – Primary Effect
Slow multiple creatures; hasten allied motions; cause projectiles to “hang” briefly; create stagger-fields that rearrange the timing (not order) of actions.
Creatures may feel like they’re moving through syrup or lightning.
Environmental Consequence (Space)
Spatial distortions ripple across the perimeter:
    • lines curve
    • floors tilt subtly
    • objects “double” briefly then merge back
Statuses:
Primary → Slowed, Hastened, Unconscious (temporal overload)
Ring → Prone, Dazed

TIER 4
Space – Primary Effect
Warp room geometry dramatically:
    • bend hallways into loops
    • make rooms intersect themselves
    • create localized non-Euclidean geometry
    • cause doorways to lead to unexpected angles
These distortions do not create new rooms; they reshape existing geometry.
Environmental Consequence (Time)
Temporal continuity breaks down at the boundary:
    • sounds replay
    • motions stutter
    • creatures sense phantom afterimages of prior movements (not time travel)
Statuses:
Primary → Prone, Blinded, Dazed
Ring → Stupification

Time – Primary Effect
Freeze areas partially (creatures move in extreme slow-motion).
Accelerate environmental processes (rust, melting, drying).
Create time-bubbles where movement is delayed or sped by whole seconds.
Pause objects mid-air without reversing or undoing motion.
Environmental Consequence (Space)
Spatial boundaries ripple:
    • walls appear to breathe
    • objects seem to sway even when stationary
    • shadows stretch unnaturally
Statuses:
Primary → Slowed, Hastened, Unconscious
Ring → Prone, Dazed

TIER 5 
Space – Primary Effect
Reshape towns or cavern systems into labyrinthine structures.
Streets may loop; walls connect unpredictably; distances alter.
Buildings remain intact but spatial relationships between them shift.
Environmental Consequence (Time)
Time dilation surrounds the zone:
    • some actions jerk ahead suddenly
    • others drag
    • creatures entering see flickers of future or past poses, but not events (temporal afterimage, not retrocausality)
Statuses:
Primary → Prone, Blinded, Dazed (severe)
Ring → Stupification, Slowed

Time – Primary Effect
Slow or hasten entire groups.
Create temporal “lakes” where time is sluggish, or temporal “rivers” where it flows rapidly.

Statuses:
Primary → Slowed, Hastened, Unconscious
Ring → Prone, Dazed

TIER 6
Space – Primary Effect
Rewrite geography on a regional scale:
    • mountains shift position
    • valleys stretch
    • coastlines fold inward
    • a city might be “pulled closer” to another
This is topological rewriting, not creation or destruction of matter.
Environmental Consequence (Time)
Time around the boundary becomes erratic:
    • mornings stretch
    • shadows flicker
    • creatures lose track of seconds or minutes
But no events are undone—only perception and pacing distort.
Statuses:
Primary → Dazed, Blinded, Prone
Ring → Stupification (severe)

Time – Primary Effect
Slow entire regions (seasons may feel long but still advance normally).
Speed up biological or ecological cycles (plants grow rapidly).
Suppress time locally into near-stillness.
This never creates paradox, memory alteration, or reversal.
Environmental Consequence (Space)
Spatial fractures appear visually:
    • objects shimmer between positions
    • distances flex
    • travelers feel stretched or compressed
No backward causality occurs.
Statuses:
Primary → Unconscious, Slowed (absolute), Stupification
Ring → Prone, Blinded
====================================
10. ARTIFICY
Imbuement (Dakar Infusion / Construct Creation) ↔ Disimbuement (Magic Removal / Radiation Purge)
Artificy is uniquely tied to Dakar radiation, gemstone imbuement, magic item creation, and construct animation.
Unlike other Faculties, Artificy’s effects often persist for hours, days, or years depending on Duration.

ARTIFICY SPECIFIC RULES
Duration of Imbuement (Enchanting Duration)
Artificy spells that imbue items last according to:
Duration Tier	Duration
1	Physical mod Minutes
2	Physical mod Hours
3	Physical mod Moon Faces
4	Physical mod Phases
5	Physical mod Cycles
6	Physical mod Years
After this period, Dakar radiation leaks out, and all unused charges vanish.

Charged Imbuement Rules
    • Imbuement allows embedding Ildakar spells into gemstones
    • These imbued gems are then bound into items (not staves/wands)
    • Each gemstone provides charges
    • Maximum charges depend on item material and gem tiers
    • When charges are used, the item takes 1–6 durability damage
    • When durability reaches 0 OR all charges are expended,
the item disintegrates (as consumed gems would)
Example:
A steel shortsword (Durability 10) holds:
    • 6 Amber-tier spells (Tier 1 gems)
    • 1 Quartz-tier spell (Tier 4 gem)
Caster has Physical 4 → Duration Tier 2 → lasts 4 Hours
If all charges are used, the sword crumbles to dust.

Special Combinations
Artificy also enables:
    • Staves/Wands: require Artificy + Transmutation
    • Undead Animation: requires Artificy + Vivomancy
    • Elemental Animation: requires Artificy + relevant Faculty
        ◦ Thermomancy → Fire/Ice elementals
        ◦ Electromancy → Storm/Charge elementals
        ◦ Pneumancy → Air/Pressure elementals
...and so on.

This Faculty is uniquely suited to:
    • Audio illusions
    • Distorting or reinforcing sound
    • Harmonic resonance damage
    • Disrupting spellcasting (counterspell)
    • Enhancing secondary effects of other spells

====================================
LUNAMANCY — Moon Phase Dominion & Planar Gates
Lunamancy also generates no environmental consequence, because energy is pulled from lunar Dakar rather than extracted locally.
Lunamancy operates under three moon phases, each completely changing the effect profile of identical intensity tiers.
Each tier’s intensity scale (1–6) corresponds directly to the fledgling → mythic creature hierarchy.
Lunamancy governs:
    • Photomancy synergy
    • Holy/mental damage conversion
    • Lycanthropic mutation
    • Planar communion (upper and lower planes)
    • Brief planar transport of spaces

====================================
PHASE 1 — HAR’PHIIEL (The Luminous Moon)
(Amplifies light, holiness, higher-plane connection)
Global Effect of This Phase
For each tier of Lunamancy used under Har’Phiiel:
    • Photomancy: Illumination spells of the same tier increase by 1 tier
    • Illumination spells deal holy spiritual damage and wounds to unaligned creatures
    • Illumination spells heal aligned creatures
Tier Effects (1–6)
Each tier may:
    • Commune with beings of the immediate higher plane
    • Enlist assistance from those beings
    • Transport target spaces briefly into the higher plane
Intensity = the tier of planar creature that can be contacted or influenced (fledgling → mythic).
No Environmental Consequence.

====================================
PHASE 2 — HAR’SUERIN (The Lycan Moon)
(Transformation, anomaly-shaping)
Global Effect
Lunamancy under Har’Suerin transforms those in the area into lycanthrope anomalies.
Intensity tier 1–6 determines the power level of the lycanthrope:
    • Tier 1 → fledgling hero
    • Tier 6 → mythic hero
Transformation may be temporary or ritualistically permanent (setting-dependent).
No Environmental Consequence.

====================================
PHASE 3 — HAR’RHUE’NEN (The Shadowed Moon)
(Amplifies darkness, mental damage, lower-plane communion)
Global Effect of This Phase
For each tier of Lunamancy used under Har’Rhuenen:
    • Photomancy: Attenuation spells increase by 1 tier
    • Attenuation spells deal mental damage and wounds to all beings with Mental −1 or higher
Tier Effects (1–6)
Each tier may:
    • Commune with beings of the immediate lower plane
    • Enlist aid of those beings
    • Transport spaces briefly into the lower plane
Intensity = the tier of planar creature influenced (fledgling → mythic).
No Environmental Consequence.
