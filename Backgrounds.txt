Four of the five stages are determined by percentile dice and thus are the least impactful.

Flaws:


* Addicted: You have an itch that cannot be scratched. A vice of yours or a substance you use controls your thoughts and emotions more than you do.
* Aggressive: Fight first and ask questions later! You find it difficult to resist battle, and often, it seems like the best or only solution to a problem. 
* Arrogant: You are better than everyone else because of your status or talents. Those who belittle or slight you had better watch out. 
* Broken: Tough living ground you down. The life you’ve lived thus far has given you a serious physical or mental condition. 
* Cloistered: You don’t remember the last time you saw someone else. Your lifestyle has led you to be an awkward loner when out of your element. 
* Cold: Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. In your life, you’ve learned to trust your mind more than your heart.
* Corrupt: It’s good to be the King! When in a position of power or authority, you cannot resist abusing or taking advantage of it to enrich yourself. 
* Craven: Life is too short. You avoid pain, danger, and confrontation whenever possible. 
* Cruel: If they wanted you to stop, they’d have asked. You go far and beyond what’s necessary when it comes to fights, disputes, and vengeance. 
* Eccentric: Nobody gets you, and that’s fine. You’re a strange person whom people find difficult to engage with, whether because of your demeanor or your interests. 
* Extravagant: You like nice things, and that’s just because you have high standards. You have lived a life of luxury and plenty that has led to your inability to cope with a substandard lifestyle.  
* Greedy: Enough is never enough! You always want more, whether it’s money, sex, status, or respect. 
* Guilty: What have you done? You’ve lived a life where you’ve had to do some nasty things, and they still haunt you. 
* Impatient: What are you waiting for? Time is of the essence, and you cannot stand it when people waste it. 
* Impulsive: Why not? If you want to do something, you have a tough time stopping yourself.
* Incurious: Who cares? You keep your nose to the grindstone, and any attempt to sway you from your path is just an inane distraction.  
* Indecisive: Left or right? Any time you have to make a decision, it’s a tough decision, and you always overthink it.  
* Jealous: You are green with envy. Any time someone has more than you or is better at something you’re good at, you cannot stand it. 
* Lazy: Why bother? You avoid work and hard things at all costs. 
* Oblivious: Nothing ever happens. You have a terrible sense of self-awareness and situational awareness. 
* Out of Touch: The little people are back. Your lifestyle has either led to you being so far removed from people due to wealth and fame, or so far away that you don’t understand normal people. 
* Overzealous: You’re very enthusiastic, and that’s good! You believe in a cause, ideology, or organization so much, it’s caused you to hate your enemies with an unquenchable burning passion. 
* Paranoid: They’re watching you! You’ve made so many enemies throughout your life, they’re bound to come for you, and for all you know, they may be around the next corner. 
* Perfectionist: Practice makes perfect! You cannot settle for subpar work, and as such, take way too long to do things, and oftentimes throw out your work altogether to restart. 
* Power Hungry: Adûrun is ripe for the taking! You aspire to gain power, influence, and might at all costs. 
* Procrastinator: You can do it later. You always put things off until the consequences of ignoring them cannot be ignored. 
* Simple: What’re they even talking about? Things ought not be complicated, and so if it is, you refuse to or cannot understand complex issues or situations.
* Stubborn: When you’re right, you’re right. Nobody else knows what they’re talking about, and you have to prove that to them. 
* Unhealthy: You hurt all over. Your lifestyle has led to a generally warped body, mind, social life, or spirit, and you refuse to do anything about it. 
* Unwise: You can just read about it. You are so wrapped up in your intellect or ideology, you’ve become unable to cope with the worldly. 
* Weak-Willed: You go with the flow. Anytime you are confronted with something difficult, you fold under the pressure.


        For flaws, roleplaying them out should allow your GM to allot you more Fate in relation to your Incite Fate skill. Flaws may also be rolled for or picked from if your GM allows it.
